This folder is for storing the calculated province midpoints from map mods as they are loaded. Initial calculation of
province midpoints can take up to 90 seconds depending on your computer, but when you load a savefile running the same
mod in the future the program will be able to find the midpoints (stored in a .csv file) here.

Do not delete this folder.
